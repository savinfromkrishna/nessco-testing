One popular type is the paper roll die cutting machine, widely used in the paper industry. These machines cut large rolls of paper into custom shapes and sizes, which are then used to create items like packaging boxes, paper cups, and other paper-based products.
         
         A roll die cutting machine is a versatile piece of equipment that cuts shapes from large rolls of material, such as paper or cardboard, without the need for manual intervention. This is achieved using specially designed machines called dies, which are customized based on the desired shape or design.`,

Wooden dies are commonly used for softer materials like paper, cardboard, and thin plastics. They are cost-effective but may wear out faster compared to metal dies.\n\nMetal Die: A metal die is made completely from metal, making it stronger and more accurate than other types. It's used for cutting more detailed designs and tougher materials. Metal dies are great for large projects that need to be very precise.",

Plastic straws take a very long time, like hundreds of years, to break down. They create pollution and can hurt animals.
